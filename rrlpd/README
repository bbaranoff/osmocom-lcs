RRLP Server
------------

- Adjust ASN1C paths in the makefile (maybe adjust the makefile too)

- ** VERY IMPORTANT **: apply ASN1C patch, otherwise invalid PDUs will 
  be generated
  
- Patches for OpenBSC are "TODO"

- Adjust IP Address of RRLP Server in OpenBSC rrlp.c (TODO: ajust code to
  get this setting from config file)
  
- Requires a u-Blox GPS receiver. The receiver is supposed to be connected
  over its USB port. Some changes are problably required if the reciver is 
  connected through its UART port (see "#define GPS_USB ..." in main.c)

- To work properly, the GPS receiver should already have a GPS fix

- Enable RRLP in OpenBSC config file ("rrlp mode ms-based")

- How to run:  (Parameter: interface IP Address where to listen, 
  GPS receiver port), e.g.:

      ./rrlp-serv 192.168.1.1 /dev/ttyS0

      
Issues:

  - "Work in Progress": code not yet properly organized and cleaned up
  
  - very verbose output for debugging/testing
  
  - rrlp.c: find out if data channel is slow (SDCCH) so that long assistance
    data will not be sent
    
  - send an RRLP request not just when paging a phone
  
  - paging: sometimes no RRLP response is reveicved !?
  
  - Location update: response of the phone got lost, channel is closed too
    early !?
  
  - GPS reference time: do we need an offset so that the time is correct when
    the phone receives it ?
